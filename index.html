      <h2>Worried about job prospects and rent increases?</h2>
      <p>Planning to move somewhere with stable job prospects and cost-effective living? From 2010 to 2015, some counties with high rents also showed significant unemployment rates. If you’re eyeing a region with low unemployment and reasonable rent, you might want to skip places like coastal counties where the cost of living is high but opportunities may not match up. Instead, look for areas with a balanced job market, affordable housing, and sustainable growth for a better quality of life. In some counties, like Knox or Allegheny, you might find a sweet spot—rents remain reasonable, and unemployment rates are low. On the other hand, places like Richmond City might present challenges with both higher costs and job insecurity. By adjusting the year slider, you can watch how these areas change over time, revealing potential trends that could help you decide where to settle down.</p>

      <h2>Thinking About Rent?</h2>
      <p>Wondering if rent in a bustling county is going to break the bank? From 2010 to 2015, rent prices in top counties climbed steadily, hinting at growing demand and limited affordability. Counties like San Francisco and Los Angeles, for instance, saw noticeable increases, making them less ideal for those seeking stable rent. However, if you’re considering long-term affordability, some counties show gentler increases. This line chart helps you predict where rent might hit hardest, guiding you towards counties that may offer more financial breathing room. You can click on a specific county in the legend to isolate and view its trend line, making it easier to compare rent trends individually.</p>
